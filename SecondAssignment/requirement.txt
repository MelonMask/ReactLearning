1. Create an input field (in App component) with a change listener which outputs the length of the entered text below it (e.g. in a paragraph)
2. Create a new component (=>Validation Component ) which receives the text length as props
3. Inside the Validation component, either output "Text too short" or "Text long enough" depending on the text length (e.g take 5 as a minimum length)
4. Create another component (=> Char component) and style it as a inline box 
5. Render a list of Char components where each Char component receives a different letter of the entered text (in the initial input field) as a prop
6. When you click a Char component, it should be removed from the entered text.
